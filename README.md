You don't need detailed instructions to use this controller on your VRoid model. But if you want to start fresh, you can just create a basic 3D project from Unity Hub, import the Character Controller Starter Assets and 3rd Person Controller asset from Unity Asset Store, then import UniVRM plugin and your character. If you don't know how to import your VRoid character to Unity, I have a tutorial about it in here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrIn9wRYqUI

For a short video demonstration, here's my video:
